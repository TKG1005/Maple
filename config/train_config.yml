# Training configuration
parallel: 5
checkpoint_interval: 500
checkpoint_dir: "checkpoints"
tensorboard: true

# Team configuration
team: "random"  # Options: default, random
teams_dir: null  # Directory for random team mode

# Opponent configuration
opponent: self  # Single opponent type: random, max, rule
opponent_mix: null  # Mixed opponents for testing

# Self-play win rate based opponent update
win_rate_threshold: 0.8  # Win rate threshold for updating opponent
win_rate_window: 100      # Number of recent battles to track

# League Training configuration (prevents catastrophic forgetting)
league_training:
  enabled: true            # Enable league training (vs historical opponents)
  historical_ratio: 0.3    # Ratio of battles against historical opponents (0.0-1.0)
  max_historical: 5        # Maximum number of historical snapshots to keep
  
  # Historical opponent selection method:
  # - "uniform": Random selection from all historical opponents (equal probability)
  #   Example: snapshots [1,2,3,4,5] → each has 20% selection chance
  # - "recent": Prefer recent historical opponents (50% from newest half)
  #   Example: snapshots [1,2,3,4,5] → [4,5] are preferred, [1,2,3] less likely
  # - "weighted": Weight by recency (newer opponents have higher selection probability)
  #   Example: snapshots [1,2,3,4,5] → weights [1,2,3,4,5], so 5 is 5x more likely than 1
  selection_method: "uniform"
  
  # Recommended settings:
  # - Early training: uniform (explore all historical strategies)
  # - Stable training: recent (focus on recent improvements)
  # - Fine-tuning: weighted (gradual transition from old to new)

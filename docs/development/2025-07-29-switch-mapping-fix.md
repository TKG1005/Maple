# Switch Mapping Logic Fix - Development Record

**Date**: 2025-07-29  
**Branch**: `debug/fix-switch-mapping`  
**Issue**: Incorrect switch mapping logic in `action_helper.py`  

## Problem Analysis

### Initial Issue Discovery
During evaluation with `evaluate_rl.py --log-action-probs`, action probability logs showed that **all 6 Pokemon** appeared as switchable options instead of only the selected team members (typically 3 Pokemon in singles format).

### Root Cause Analysis

#### 1. **Conceptual Confusion: Full Team vs Selected Team**
- **Full Team**: 6 Pokemon available in Team Preview
- **Selected Team**: 3-4 Pokemon chosen for battle (format dependent)
- **Problem**: Original code mixed these concepts

#### 2. **Misuse of `battle.available_switches`**
```python
# Original problematic assumption
switches = battle.available_switches  # Contains ALL non-active, non-fainted Pokemon
# Reality: This includes non-selected Pokemon in team selection formats
```

#### 3. **Logical Inconsistencies**
- `get_action_mapping()`: Used full team positions (0-5)
- `action_index_to_order()`: Expected selected team positions (0-2)
- **Result**: Mapping/translation mismatch causing runtime errors

#### 4. **Redundant Filtering**
```python
# Unnecessary double-filtering
switches = [p for p in switches if not getattr(p, 'fainted', False)]
# battle.available_switches already excludes fainted Pokemon
```

## Solution Implementation

### Phase 1: Initial Fix Attempt
**Commit**: `a8fb09f25` - "fix: Correct switch mapping logic in action_helper.py"

**Changes**:
- Simplified position mapping to use selected team positions consistently
- Removed complex triple-validation logic (ident/species/object)
- Updated both `action_index_to_order_from_mapping` and `action_index_to_order`

**Result**: Logical consistency improved but still included non-selected Pokemon

### Phase 2: Selected Team Constraint Fix
**Commit**: `d48f6e2f0` - "fix: Properly handle selected team constraints in switch mapping"

**Key Innovation**: Focus on selected team as the authoritative source

#### New Algorithm:
```python
def get_switchable_positions_in_selected_team():
    # 1. Get selected team from battle request
    selected_team = request['side']['pokemon']
    
    # 2. Check each position in selected team only
    for i, selected_mon in enumerate(selected_team):
        # 3. Three-tier validation:
        #    a) Not active Pokemon
        #    b) Not fainted (from selected team data)
        #    c) Present in available_switches (game state validation)
        
        if (not_active and not_fainted and available_for_switch):
            switchable_positions.append(i)
```

#### Benefits:
- **Scope Limitation**: Only considers selected team Pokemon
- **Authoritative Validation**: Uses `available_switches` for game state verification
- **Position Consistency**: All functions use same position system (0-based selected team)

## Technical Details

### File Modified
- `src/action/action_helper.py`

### Functions Updated
- `get_action_mapping()` - Core mapping generation
- `action_index_to_order_from_mapping()` - Action translation
- `action_index_to_order()` - Action translation (legacy)
- `get_available_actions_with_details()` - Debug information

### Code Metrics
- **Lines Changed**: 124 insertions(+), 134 deletions(-) (Phase 1)
- **Lines Changed**: 47 insertions(+), 38 deletions(-) (Phase 2)
- **Net Result**: Simpler, more maintainable code

## Testing Approach

### Problem Reproduction
```bash
python evaluate_rl.py --model checkpoints/model.pt --opponent random --n 1 --log-action-probs
```

### Expected Behavior Change

#### Before Fix:
```
Action probabilities:
  Switch to Pikachu: 15.2%      # Selected team position 0 (active)
  Switch to Charizard: 18.4%    # Selected team position 1 ✓
  Switch to Blastoise: 12.1%    # Selected team position 2 ✓  
  Switch to Venusaur: 8.3%      # Non-selected ❌
  Switch to Alakazam: 7.8%      # Non-selected ❌
  Switch to Machamp: 9.1%       # Non-selected ❌
```

#### After Fix:
```
Action probabilities:
  Switch to Charizard: 31.2%    # Selected team position 1 ✓
  Switch to Blastoise: 28.7%    # Selected team position 2 ✓
  (2 invalid actions masked)
```

## Architecture Improvements

### 1. **Single Source of Truth**
- Selected team (`battle._last_request['side']['pokemon']`) as primary reference
- `battle.available_switches` used only for validation

### 2. **Consistent Position System**
- All functions use 0-based selected team positions
- Pokemon Showdown protocol conversion (1-based) only at message generation

### 3. **Defensive Programming**
- Graceful error handling with warning logs
- Fallback behavior when request data unavailable
- Exception safety in position calculation

## Impact Assessment

### Performance
- **Positive**: Reduced computational complexity by eliminating redundant filtering
- **Positive**: Fewer Pokemon to process in switch mapping

### Correctness
- **Critical Fix**: Eliminates invalid switch options in team selection formats
- **Critical Fix**: Ensures position mapping consistency across all functions

### Maintainability
- **Improved**: Clear separation of concerns (selection vs game state)
- **Improved**: Self-documenting code with explicit validation steps
- **Improved**: Reduced code duplication

## Future Considerations

### 1. **Format Compatibility**
Current fix handles:
- ✅ Singles (3v3 team selection)
- ✅ Doubles (4v4 team selection)  
- ✅ Full team formats (6v6)

### 2. **Edge Cases to Monitor**
- Team Preview vs Battle transition timing
- Tournament format variations
- Custom format rulesets

### 3. **Integration Points**
- Action probability logging (`ActionProbabilityLogger`)
- State observation (`StateObserver`)
- AI agent decision making (`RLAgent`)

## Lessons Learned

### 1. **Domain Knowledge Critical**
Understanding Pokemon Showdown's team selection mechanics was essential for correct implementation.

### 2. **Data Source Hierarchy**
- **Primary**: Battle request data (authoritative for selections)
- **Secondary**: poke-env computed properties (derived state)
- **Validation**: Cross-reference between sources

### 3. **Testing Strategy**
Logging-based verification (`--log-action-probs`) proved invaluable for detecting subtle logic errors that unit tests might miss.
